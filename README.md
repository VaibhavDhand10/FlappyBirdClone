# Flappy Bird – Unity Clone 🐦🎮

A Unity-powered recreation of the iconic mobile game, **Flappy Bird**, built from scratch in under 3 hours as a fun speed development challenge!

This project replicates the classic one-button gameplay that made Flappy Bird such a viral hit, complete with obstacle spawning, flap mechanics, and pixel-perfect frustration.

## 🔑 Features

- 🕹️ **Tap-to-Flap Mechanic**: Simple input that controls bird physics using Unity's RigidBody2D
- 🧱 **Pipe Obstacle Spawning**: Timed pipes with random vertical offsets to increase difficulty
- ♻️ **Endless Scrolling**: Background and ground scroll infinitely to simulate forward motion
- 📊 **Score Tracking**: Real-time score increases with each pipe cleared
- 💥 **Game Over Logic**: Collision detection with pipes and ground
- 🔁 **Restart System**: Retry the game immediately after failing — just like the original
- 🎮 **Minimal UI**: Start, Game Over, and Score panels animated in and out
- 📦 **Lightweight Build**: Built for quick prototyping and responsive gameplay
